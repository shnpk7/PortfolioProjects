-- STEP 1: CLARIFY THE DATA

-- Standardize date format
ALTER TABLE purchases_clean 
ALTER COLUMN "Order date" TYPE DATE 
USING TO_DATE("Order date", 'YYYY-MM-DD');

-- Standardize price format
ALTER TABLE purchases_clean
ALTER COLUMN "Purchase price per unit" TYPE NUMERIC(10,2) USING "Purchase price per unit"::NUMERIC(10,2);

-- Standardize quantity format  
ALTER TABLE purchases_clean
ALTER COLUMN "Quantity" TYPE INTEGER USING "Quantity"::FLOAT::INTEGER;

-- Remove non-critical rows, as dataset is limited to Oct 2022
SELECT 
	DATE_TRUNC('month', "Order date")::DATE AS order_date,
	SUM("Purchase price per unit" * "Quantity") AS revenue
FROM purchases_clean
GROUP BY 1

DELETE FROM purchases_clean
WHERE DATE_PART('year', "Order date") BETWEEN 2023 AND 2024;


-- STEP 2: LOCATE SOLVABLE ISSUES

-- Remove rows unrelated to actual product sales
DELETE FROM purchases_clean
WHERE "Title" ILIKE '%gift card%'
   OR "Title" ILIKE '%gift code%'
   OR "Title" ILIKE '%Amazon reload%'
   

-- STEP 3: EVALUATE UNSOLVABLE ISSUES

-- Check null values
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
    SUM(CASE WHEN "Order date" IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_order_date,
    SUM(CASE WHEN "Purchase price per unit" IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_price,

/* There are some null values in the address, title, product code, and category columns.
Since the % of missing values is small (<5% in all columns), weâ€™ll keep the data as is
and exclude them in data visualization */


-- STEP 4: AUGMENT THE DATA 

-- Add revenue column for cleaner code
ALTER TABLE purchases_clean
ADD COLUMN revenue NUMERIC;

UPDATE purchases_clean
